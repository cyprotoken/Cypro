Abstract
More than 200 years ago, the first industrial revolution brought major
innovations especially to steam engines, machines, and tools. As technology
was in course of developing, the world saw a second and a third revolution
which was mainly based on mass production, respectively automatization.

Today we are currently living in a world dominated by Industry 4.0, therefore by cyber-physical systems which involve transdisciplinary approaches and
merge the domains of cybernetics, mechatronics, design and process science
in real life. In this context, new business models are needed in order to follow all requirements of the latest industrial revolution.

The first aim of Cypro is accepting to among the cryptocurrency: Cypru’s new currency Cypro

However, Cypro shows great potential for the future, taking into
consideration that all cypriots can already use it in multiple ways in their
daily lives, and even more acceptance fields are yet to come.

Cypro has started using its cryptocurrency in multiple areas and has significantly expanded its acceptance areas. A logical consequence for Cypro is to be a lifestyle-related token.

A digital currency meant to expand your horizon

The world of cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are completely decentralized, secured by cryptography,
transparent and global, therefore shaping the future of the business sector.
The main differences between standard assets and the
blockchain technology are:

•	The transfer of tokens is cheap and fast in contrast to the standard
assets.
•	Digital assets (i.e. tokens) can be sent peer-to-peer, which means there is
no need for any third party and/or an intermediary in order to transfer
digital assets.
•	Digital assets are open to everyone, neutral and fully global. There are no
borders, anyone in the world can get digital assets without any permission	by using peer-to-peer token transfer.
•	Digital assets can be used as a medium of exchange.
Digital assets are programmable with smart contracts, which allow much more flexibility than traditional assets.





The Ethereum platform
The Ethereum blockchain is a platform that allows everyone to create his own decentralized cryptocurrency, decentralized autonomous organizations
(DAOs) and decentralized applications (Dapps) by using smart contracts.

Blockchain technology brings revolutionary benefits to any project, compared with the traditional one. The strongest benefit of blockchain is
decentralization. The decentralized open blockchain runs smart contracts as
programmed without any fraud, censorship, downtime and external
third-party disruption. Furthermore, there is no need for a trusted third party or intermediary to validate transactions on open blockchain platforms.

Transparency represents another strong benefit achieved by the usage of
blockchain. Since the blocks are distributed to every node on the system,
everybody is able to see what is on the blockchain. Therefore, each transaction is transparent on the blockchain. Lastly, since the whole ecosystem is distributed, it is extremely difficult to hack the system, which provides strong security.

No fraud, censorship, downtime, and external third-party disruption



Cypro and the Ethereum platform
Cypro basiert auf der Ethereum-Blockchain ERC20 und nutzt damit die Vorteile der Ethereum-Blockchain voll aus.

Cypro is an Ethereum blockchain-based ERC20 token that uses almost all
the benefits of the Ethereum blockchain. There will be new blockchain system for Cypro users. Cypro-chain will be in system soon.

Cypro can be used or stored by all people who have an Ethereum address!

A token for your daily life
Mission

Cypro's initial goal is to connect investments that serve the values of Cyprus with cryptocurrencies.

Vision

Cypro Token is a more comprehensive project than other cryptocurrency projects. Through the project, Cypro's mission is to serve associations that benefit society, from arts to education, from eco-agriculture to eco-energy, from animal rights to many more.

Cypro Token entered the crypto world as a token. In the next phase after the IPO, our software developers will create their own blockchain for Cypro, which works with renewable energy. In this context, anyone with a smartphone and a watch becomes part of this extensive blockchain network through the Cypro app.

Cypro will launch his Cypriot NFT and METAVERSE project after moving to its own blockchain network.





Why Cypro?

After becoming the number one cryptocurrency in Cyprus, Cypro now has a real chance to become one of the most used cryptocurrencies in real life. The value of Cypro will increase exponentially over time as the number of acceptance points increases and Cypro becomes more widely used.

It's not just a cryptocurrency made up of numbers on the computer screen, it's a cryptocurrency that serves the most beautiful island in the Mediterranean!
